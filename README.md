# WhatMakesAHitSong 

Context
A dataset of 2017 songs with attributes from Spotify's API. Each song is labeled "1" meaning I like it and "0" for songs I don't like. I used this to data to see if I could build a classifier that could predict whether or not I would like a song. 

Content
Each row represents a song.

There are 16 columns. 13 of which are song attributes, one column for song name, one for artist, and a column called "target" which is the label for the song.

Here are the 13 track attributes: acousticness, danceability, durationms, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, timesignature, valence.

Information on what those traits mean can be found here: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-audio-features/

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Spotify for providing this readily accessible data.

Inspiration
I'm a music lover who's curious about why I love the music that I love.
